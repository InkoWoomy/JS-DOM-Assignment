We created functionality for two inputs and buttons that:
1. Allows you to input 1 of 8 boxes a given color once the "change color" button is pressed
2. Allows you to reset the colors of all 8 boxes with the "reset all box colors" button

Review
"everything works. looks good. in box 5 there is some text outside the h1 tage you might want to get rid of. one of the suggestions that bryan gave to me that you could probably have also done, just for visibility sake, was to use a switch statement instead of a bunch of nested if statement but they essentially do the same thing. also they told me if I wanted to implement check if input was not an available one, an alert would be better than just a console log saying not found."
